*Funnel* is a minimal [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info) server plugin for
Unity Pro. It allows Unity to share frames with other application in
realtime. It works not only on built apps but also on the Editor, therefore you
can edit a scene on the Editor and simultaneously show it on Syphon clients
(e.g. MadMapper, VDMX, et cetera).

System Requirements
-------------------

- Mac OS X
- Unity Pro
- Syphon client app.

Setting Up
----------

- [Download the plugin package]
  (https://github.com/keijiro/Funnel/raw/master/Funnel.unitypackage).
- Import the package into your project.
- Add Funnel script component to a camera.

Basically that's all! It publishes frames on this camera in play mode.
It uses the name of the game object as the name of the Syphon server, and
therefore you can identify servers with their names.

Options
-------

There are some options you can see on the inspector.

![Inspector](http://keijiro.github.io/Funnel/inspector.png)

- Screen Width/Height - the size of frames published to Syphon clients.
- Draw Game View - draws the frames on the game view. If this option is
  disabled, the frames on this camera is only viewable on Syphon clients.
- Preview - shows the frames on this camera (on very low frame rate).

Editor to show frames on Retina-enabled displays or external displays
in full-screen mode.
